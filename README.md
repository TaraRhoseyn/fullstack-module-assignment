# React Project Example

## Starting up the frontend server
Change directory into the correct dir:
```
cd client
```
Start up the node server to run the React instance:
```
npm start
```
This will export a local port on your PC and you can visit your React site.

Create docker image:
```
docker image build -t fullstack-module-assignment-image .
```
